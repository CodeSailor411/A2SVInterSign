# InterSign

InterSign is designed to assist the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by providing real-time sign language translation through AI-generated avatars. The application supports various contexts, including media & entertainment, education, and video calls messaging. InterSign operates as a desktop and mobile app that runs in the background, capturing any sound output from the device and translating it into sign language.


# How It Works
InterSign captures the audio output from the user's device and uses AI models to convert the audio into sign language. The translated sign language is then displayed using a generative AI avatar that overlays on top of other applications. This avatar can be moved around the screen, providing flexibility and ease of use.

In addition to translating audio to sign language, InterSign also enables users to communicate through sign language using their webcam. The application uses computer vision models to recognize the user's sign language gestures and convert them into speech, which is then output through the user's microphone. This bidirectional translation facilitates seamless communication between deaf and hearing individuals.
